		I am delighted to know that <b><i>Shri Dharmasthala Manjunatheshwara College of Engineering and
				Technology<i></b>,
		Dharwad, is entering its forty fourth year. I appreciate the services and efforts by the Principal,
		Faculty and Staff making the Institution being consistently <b><u>ranked high among Engineering Colleges in
				India and in Karnataka</u></b>.
		Ultimately, all these credentials will reflect on the students education and their future prospects.
		Teachers participation should be continued in the same spirit of achieving the common goal of meaningful
		education to students with clarity,
		dignity and integrity I also hope that <b>SDMCET</b> will further grow in academics and the students studying in
		this Institution will bring laurels by their extraordinary talent.
		May <span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: larger;">Lord Manjunatha Swamy shower his choicest
			Blessings on you all</span>.
